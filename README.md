# prj-rev-bwfs-tea-cozy
This is a hypothetical home page/website for a high-end consumer tea company called, "Tea Cozy".
The site was created in mid-August by Sean Garvey, an aspiring web developer.
This site's creation was a project for a paid course (formerly called CodeREADY) through Codecademy.com.
In retrospect, I wish I would have made this on my Windows laptop while running Git so I could have committed each version/stage of the development process.
Unfortunately, because I am using a stock Chromebook, running/using git for version control was not an option. 
So, I just built the site in entirety using a simple Chrome-based text editor called Caret for both the HTML and the CSS on my default Acer Chromebook 15, running the Chromium OS, not a dual-boot Linux. (SHAME!) Sorry Guys!
Therefore, it is pretty bare-bones but it totally is functional and works.  
Feel free to use a browser, like my favorite, Chrome, to render the code to see how the site looks and feels, i.e. delivers and performs.
Don't expect to have your mind blown but do expect to see a neatly-organized site that incorporates a few noticeable things; 
Notice the following: 
1. a fixed header that stays in place as you scroll (and that prevents other images from rendering behind, underneath, or ontop of it at all points in time and space), 
2. some flexbot useage for flex-containers' settings plus miniminal useage for vertically centering (justifying-content of) flex-items, 
3. foreground images (as flex-items) with alt descriptions as back-up if they don't render properly, and background images with text/captions overlayed or aligned nearby, 
4. basically, all the text is (horizontally) centered, i.e. text-align value set to center (except for the copyright/footer which had the text aligned to the left), 
5. some margin and padding play/manipulations to enhance/clarify spacing and seperation between items and topics, both visually and semantically, to make understanding easier and clearer,
6. bolded headings for emphasis and to distinguish between headings and other, large-sized (non-heading) text
7. consistent color-scheme for (the universal) primary set-up: seashell on black background. seashell color for all text, utilizing varying degrees of opacity, boldness, and sizes, and Black for the background-color for everything.
8. utilized an HTML entity to make a copyright symbol in the footer; replaced the word "Copyright" with a copyright symbol (that works/renders) in the phrase "Copyright 2017 Tea Cozy"
9. created three black rectangles with seashell colored text that describe store/company locations, that overlays the top of a background image while simultaneously being vertically centered (the boxes are in the vertical-middle). And the boxes are horizontally centered too, while having some manually-set space between each of them.
10. coded all the CSS on its own stylesheet so there is not one bit of inline-styling nor any <style> tags in my HTML
11. added comments to my HTML to let the reader/DevTools-user know when each new section was beginning
12. when adding images to the site, I used a mixture of both url's for the img tag's src property value as well as using/linking local (downloaded) photo files as the src value, in other instances, in improve rendering speed, and reduce GitHub repository size.
13. used a spec-sheet as one of the primary basis of development for my CSS and somewhat for my HTML as well too
14. relied on a mock/example version of an already complete version of the site using Chrome's DevTools to analyze the HTML and understand the developer's decision making process
15. (when I had doubt about which option to go with or how to create the desired effect,) I resourcefully replicated the HTML and CSS seen via DevTools step-by-step, line-by-line, piece-by-piece until I not only had the functionality needed but also could/did understand why he/she chose the method/structure/syntax/style, i.e. choice out of many potentials. I didn't just clone everything but I did compare my work/code with the DevTools after significant progress/time to ensure I hadn't deviated too far from the "projected path" and if I did, then I'd assess whether or not I was still on target and what could be learned from the experience.
16. basically, modeled an entire website off of another live website's HTML and CSS via Chrome's DevTools and Caret (a simple Text Editor), while making my own adjustments and stylings.
17. uploaded to github
18. made this ridiculous, thorough, thoughtful, and pretty brutally honest ReadMe
19. made you aware of steps you'd probably never even have realized nor thought of
20. DOESN'T THE SITE SIMPLY LOOK NICE, CLEAN, UNCLUTTERED, AND (RELATIVELY) PROFESSIONAL? Oh let's not downplay the importance of the fact that you were (or should have been) able to have opened the website at all by opening the index.html file with your browser (Chrome)?

CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU AND TO I, BOTH! We've reached the end of this long, and arduous journey of mutual-growth and live-learning together! ;-) Sarcasm was implied but I'm going back to serious mode now.
If you made it this far, I truly, sincerely, overtly thank you. :-D You, simply, are a spectacular specimen of the best of what makes us human. Simply put, You Genuinely Care [About Learning, Others, The Spread of Knowledge and Joy, and Self-Improvement, etc.]. And for that, not just I and not just the world, but THE FUTURE ITSELF THANKS YOU!  Kudos. And Congrats... on the awesomeness.  
Keep it up; I hear passion is contagious! Try sharing some of yours sometime. Who knows what dream(s) you could be responsible for helping turn into reality, simply by providing the inspiration? Let's find out together!
 
-To "Our" Success!,
Sean Tank Garvey
